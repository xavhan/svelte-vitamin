# svelte-vitamin

Try to build on my own a svelte wrapper around [vitamin design system](https://www.decathlon.design/)

Goal is to do some experiments and maybe, be integrated in or replace [@vtmn/svelte](https://www.decathlon.design/726f8c765/p/41193f-ui-libraries/t/23bddb)

## Ideas

- only abstract markup and class mechanics, avoid state mecanics such as hide/show
- try to find some logic to classes naming construction (still wip)
- heavily inspired by the code simplicity of [sveltestrap](https://github.com/bestguy/sveltestrap)
- build as much as possible to catch up with the other wrappers

## Overview

- light use of typescript (not much to do with it)
- storybook
- cover the existing css as much as possible (some features are not yet implemented)
- 12/18 components available
